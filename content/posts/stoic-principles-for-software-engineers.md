I am a Software Engineer (SWE) by profession. The work of a SWE involves designing software, writing code, and solving problems.
Software Engineering or any Engineering for that matter, tests the mental strength of an Engineer.
This mental strength is the true power. Making clear decisions based on the clarity of information available is the real skill of a SWE.
I constantly look to improve my thought process and cut the unwanted noise from my life.

Lately, I have stumbled upon a philosophy that I think is a practical way of living life i.e. __Stoicism__.
_Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy that taught a particular way of living._ People who follow Stoicism are called __Stoics__.

I feel, that becoming stoic can benefit SWEs greatly in their work.
That is what this blog post is about - Stoic Principles for SWEs to follow and corresponding applications relating to work situations.

#### **Focus on What You Can Control**
- You’re assigned a task outside your comfort zone. Instead of worrying about your lack of experience, focus on learning and asking questions to get the job done.
- Your code isn’t working as expected. Concentrate on debugging systematically, one step at a time, rather than stressing over the entire problem.

#### **Cultivate Professional Virtue**
- Write tests and document your code to ensure it's understandable and maintainable for others.
- Be honest about what you don’t know and communicate promptly.

#### **Develop Resilience**
- When your code fails in testing, approach it calmly. Use the opportunity to strengthen your understanding of the system.
- You didn’t meet an expected timeline. Reflect on what you can do better next time and ask for advice on improving your workflow.

#### **Practice Mindfulness**
- Start your day by setting clear, achievable goals and tackle them one by one.
- During meetings, listen actively and fully engage with the discussion, ensuring that your contributions are thoughtful and constructive.
- Reflect on your day at the end of each workday, noting what you achieved and where you can improve, to start the next day with clarity.

#### **Build Strong Relationships**
- Participate actively in team discussions, offering your ideas while being open to learning from others.
- Take the time to mentor juniors, providing guidance and support that helps them grow into strong contributors.
